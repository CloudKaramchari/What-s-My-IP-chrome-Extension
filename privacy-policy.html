  <h1>Privacy Policy for "What's My IP"</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 19 June 2025</p>

  <p><em>"What's My IP"</em> is a Chrome extension that displays your public IP address by retrieving it from a secure, third-party API. This privacy policy outlines what data is accessed and how it is used.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>This extension retrieves your current public IP address by making a request to a third-party API service: <a href="https://api.ipify.org" target="_blank">https://api.ipify.org</a>. No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected, stored, or transmitted by this extension.</p>

  <h2>2. Use of Data</h2>
  <p>The IP address is displayed locally within the extension popup and is not stored or sent to any servers controlled by the developer. It is used strictly to fulfill the core purpose of the extension: showing the user their public IP address.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p><em>"What's My IP"</em> does not sell, share, or transfer any data to third parties. The only external service used is <a href="https://www.ipify.org" target="_blank">ipify.org</a>, whose API returns the public IP address.</p>

  <h2>4. Security</h2>
  <p>This extension runs entirely in your browser and does not store or transmit data to any developer-controlled servers. All API calls are made directly from your local browser.</p>

  <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or the extension, please contact us at: <br>
